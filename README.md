## Analysis of Global Health Statistics

**Overview**

This an interactive analysis of global health outcomes, to uncover disease prevalence, treatment trends, and system-level performance indicators. Through data visualization and dynamic filtering, the dashboard offers a clear and actionable view of how healthcare, socioeconomic, and developmental factors influence population health.

The analysis aims to bridge data insights with decision-making — empowering policymakers, researchers, and healthcare administrators to identify trends, evaluate progress, and target interventions that improve both efficiency and outcomes in health systems worldwide.

**Dataset Description:** The dataset contains detailed metrics on:

- **Disease Indicators** – Prevalence, incidence, mortality, and recovery rates.
- **Healthcare Infrastructure** – Healthcare access %, doctors per 1,000 people, hospital beds per 1,000 people.
- **Treatment Information** – Primary treatment type, average treatment cost, availability of vaccines/treatments.
- **Socio-Economic Factors** – Per capita income, education index, urbanization rate.
- **Outcome Measures** – Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and five-year improvement rates.

Geographic & Temporal Coverage: Data from multiple countries and years, enabling both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis.

**Use Cases**
1. **Healthcare Policy Optimization** – Prioritize investments and interventions in regions with high disease burdens or low recovery rates.
2. **Epidemiological Insight** – Understand the relationship between health outcomes and socioeconomic development factors.
3. **Strategic Health Planning** – Support evidence-based decision-making for improving health access, affordability, and equity.

**What’s Happening?**

The dashboard visualizes key health indicators — **Treatment cost**, **Recovery rate**, **DALYs**, and **mortality rate** — to reveal year-over-year shifts in both financial and clinical performance.

While prevalence and incidence depict the disease burden, the broader outcome narrative emerges from integrating multiple dimensions, offering a holistic view of healthcare effectiveness and progress over time.

**Who and What Factors Contribute?**

Health outcomes are influenced by more than just medical treatment. Developmental factors such as **Education Index**, **Healthcare Access**, and **Urbanization Rate** significantly shape care quality and equity.

Countries with stronger education systems, better healthcare infrastructure, and higher urbanization levels often achieve higher recovery rates and lower mortality, demonstrating how social development drives public health resilience.

**Why It Matters, and What Can Be Done**

Analyzing trends in recovery versus mortality alongside DALYs across diseases reveals not just progress, but also persistent gaps in health outcomes.

By connecting these measures with economic and developmental indicators, stakeholders can identify where targeted investments in education, healthcare access, or infrastructure will yield the most sustainable improvements in health systems and patient outcomes.
